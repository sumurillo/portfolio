    <h1>About Me Page</h1><br>
        <p>My name is Sumire Shinjo. I am a software engineer with a background in healthcare and customer service.
        With over 10 years of solution-focused experience, I have the ability to communicate with key stakeholders 
        and use critical thinking and problem solving skills to code software products that are innovative and 
        meet the needs of clients. I excel in environments where I can continuously learn new skills, collaborate 
        with teams, and make a positive impact.</p>

        <p>I was born in Okinawa, Japan and raised in the US for 10+ years. I am a creative person who always looks 
        for innovative ways to make user experience better. Between creating and engineering designs to taking picture 
        perfect moments, I deliver products that gives the best visual appeal.</p>

        <p>I have always been an empathetic person who puts the needs of others and do everything in my power to the best
        of my abilities to accommodate those needs. I thrive in areas where I can have a positive impact on others. My 
        passion has always been in growth and change I see in others that I can be a part of.</p><br>
